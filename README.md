# Tkinter-Game-Center

A simple Tkinter project before moving on to a different GUI maker for python
Inside are two games (currently, may add more later...)
There are two buttons which will take you away from the main window and open the either windows of the game of your choice
****I also tried to use pyinstaller with the folder to make a .exe file for the tkinter but not sure if it will let you download and try on your pc****
One game is tic-tac-toe:
      1. Mainly for two players to play against each other
RPS:
      1.Player vs. Computer
      2.Window pops up with three choices and a message info will pop up to tell you who won
